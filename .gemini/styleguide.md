# Kotlin and Java Style Guide

# Introduction
This style guide outlines the coding conventions for Kotlin and Java code development.

# Key Principles
* **Readability:** Code should be easy to understand for all team members.
* **Maintainability:** Code should be easy to modify and extend.
* **Consistency:** Adhering to a consistent style across all projects improves
  collaboration and reduces errors.
* **Performance:** While readability is paramount, code should be efficient.
* **Idiomatic:** Use language-specific idioms and best practices.

## Imports
* **Wildcards:** Avoid wildcard imports (`import com.example.*`) for clarity.
* **Import order:**  Sort alphabetically.

## Comments
* **Write clear and concise comments:** Explain the "why" behind the code, not just the "what".
* **Comment sparingly:** Well-written code should be self-documenting where possible.
* **Use complete sentences:** Start comments with a capital letter and use proper punctuation.
